## Updating ImmoTool-Server {#admin_server_update}

ImmoTool-Server is updated much more rarely compared to ImmoTool. In contradiction to ImmoTool the ImmoTool-Server does **not check for updates automatically**. Therefore you should visit the [OpenEstate website](https://openestate.org/) regularly or subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://openestate.org/news/feed/en/rss/) in order to get notifications about updates.

Download the installation package for your operating system and start the installation process (see ["Installing ImmoTool-Server"]({{< relref "../../intro/install_server.md#intro_install_server" >}})). Thereby keep the following notices for your operating system in mind.

{{< warning >}}
Always close the ImmoTool-Server application before starting the update process.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< tip >}}
In order to avoid a data loss in case of an error, it is recommended to backup the [data directory]({{< relref "directories.md#admin_server_directories_data" >}}) before starting the update procedure.
{{< /tip >}}


### Update on Windows {#admin_server_update_windows}

The **EXE** installer automatically detects, where the application was installed beforehand and will update the files accordingly.

{{< warning >}}
If you made custom modifications to the [configuration directory]({{< relref "directories.md#admin_server_directories_etc" >}}), you should backup all files in this directory before installing the update. Afterwards you can copy the modified files back.
{{< /warning >}}


### Update on macOS {#admin_server_update_mac}

Move the application symbol of **"OpenEstate-ImmoServer"** to the same location, where ImmoTool-Server was installed beforehand. The operating system will show the following question:

{{< figure src="update_mac.png" caption="Question about overwriting on macOS" >}}

{{< todo >}}
Provide an English screenshot.
{{< /todo >}}

Answer this question in the dialog window by clicking on **"Replace"**.


### Update on Debian, Ubuntu & Co. {#admin_server_update_debian}

If the Debian repository was configured in your operating system (see ["Obtain packages from the Debian repository"]({{< relref "../../intro/download.md#intro_download_debian" >}})), you do **not** have to download the updated version from the OpenEstate website. Instead you can execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openestate-immoserver
```

If you do **not** use the Debian repository but installed the program from the [**Debian** package]({{< relref "../../intro/install_client.md#intro_install_client_setup_debian" >}}), you can download the **DEB** installation package. Install the downloaded package with a double click or via the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i openestate-immoserver_x.y.z_amd64.deb
```

Replace **`x.y.z`** with the version number of the downloaded file.

{{< warning >}}
If you made custom modifications to the [configuration directory]({{< relref "directories.md#admin_server_directories_etc" >}}), you should backup all files in this directory before installing the update. Afterwards you can copy the modified files back.
{{< /warning >}}


### Update on Linux {#admin_server_update_linux}

1.  Find out the path, where ImmoTool-Server was installed beforehand.
2.  Download the **TAR.GZ** installation package for your Linux system and extract the file on your computer. 
3.  Rename the folder, you have determined in step 1 - e.g. **`OpenEstate-ImmoServer-OLD`**.
4.  Create a new / empty folder with the name, you have determined in step 1 - e.g. **`OpenEstate-ImmoServer`**.
5.  Copy the files, that were extracted in step 2 into the newly created / empty folder.

After you have been able to properly start the application in the updated version you might remove the temporary folder created in step 3.

{{< warning >}}
If you made custom modifications to the [configuration directory]({{< relref "directories.md#admin_server_directories_etc" >}}), you should backup all files in this directory before installing the update. Afterwards you can copy the modified files back.
{{< /warning >}}


### Important advices for certain versions {#admin_server_update_advices}

This section contains advices about updates to certain application versions.


#### Update from version 1.0-beta to 1.x {#admin_server_update_advices_beta}

ImmoTool-Server 1.0.0 introduced some major changes, that should be considered during an update from version 1.0-beta.


##### New directories {#admin_server_update_advices_beta_directories}

In contrast to the 1.0-beta version ImmoTool-Server does not save the databases in the application directory anymore. Before the old application directory is removed, you **absolutely should backup the contents of the `var/data` subfolder** from the old application directory.

After the new version of ImmoTool-Server was installed, start the application for the first time and shutdown the application afterwards immediately. This will create the new [data directory]({{< relref "directories.md#admin_server_directories_data" >}}). Open this directory and copy the previously saved contents of the **`var/data`** subfolder into the newly created **`data`** subfolder of the [data directory]({{< relref "directories.md#admin_server_directories_data" >}}).

You should find an already existing **`data`** subfolder. Remove or rename this folder before copying files into it.

Future updates of ImmoTool-Server 1.x do not require these steps and should work flawlessly.


##### New mechanism for services {#admin_server_update_advices_beta_services}

Installation of services have been completely reworked with ImmoTool-Server 1.0.0. If you are using a service for the previous version, you should **remove the service from the operating system before starting the update**. In order to remove the service execute the **`ServiceUninstall.bat`** or **`ServiceUninstall.sh`** script in the **`bin`** directory of the old ImmoTool-Server installation.

After the new version of ImmoTool-Server was installed you can reinstall its service (see ["Setup a service for ImmoTool-Server"]({{< relref "service.md#admin_server_service" >}})).

Future updates of ImmoTool-Server 1.x do not require these steps and should work flawlessly. 


##### New installation routine for Windows & macOS {#admin_server_update_advices_beta_installer}

A **new installation routine** was implemented for **Windows** and **macOS** systems (EXE and DMG installation packages). The new installation packages are not compatible with the old update procedure. Please make sure, that you **do not overwrite** the previous ImmoTool-Server version while installing the update. Therefore we are recommending the following approach:

-   Find out, in which folder ImmoTool-Server 1.0-beta is currently installed on your hard drive. 

    -   If the application is located on Windows systems at **`C:\Programme\OpenEstate-ImmoServer`**, you should rename this folder - e.g. in **`C:\Programme\OpenEstate-ImmoServer-OLD`**.
    
    -   On macOS systems there should not be a problem with the naming of the folder. But nevertheless you should figure out, where the application is located.
    
-   On Windows you should remove of the application (from the Desktop or start menu). On macOS you might remove the application from the Dock.

-   Start the installation procedure (see ["Installing ImmoTool-Server"]({{< relref "../../intro/install_server.md#intro_install_server" >}})).

-   If the application was successfully updated and the database was copied (see ["New directories"]({{< relref "update.md#admin_server_update_advices_beta_directories" >}})), you can remove the installation folder of ImmoTool-Server 1.0-beta.

Future updates of ImmoTool-Server 1.x do not require these steps and should work flawlessly. 


##### Java can be removed {#admin_server_update_advices_beta_java}

Since version 1.0.0 Java is bundled together with the ImmoTool-Server application. Therefore you can **remove Java from your operating system** as long as you do not need it for other applications.  

-   On Windows you can open the system control panel and open the section for software removal. You should find an entry for **"Oracle Java"**, that can be removed.

-   On macOS you can follow these steps in order to remove **"Oracle Java"**:

    1.  Click on the **"Finder"** icon located in your dock.
    2.  Click on **"Go"** in the Finder menu.
    3.  Click on **"Utilities"**.
    4.  Double-click on the **"Terminal"** icon.
    5.  In the Terminal window copy and paste the commands below:
    
        ```bash
        sudo rm -fr /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin
        sudo rm -fr /Library/PreferencePanes/JavaControlPanel.prefPane
        sudo rm -fr ~/Library/Application\ Support/Oracle/Java
        ```

    (quoted from the [official instructions by Oracle](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml))

-   On Linux you might remove **"OpenJDK"** via the package system of your distribution. Or if **"Oracle Java"** was installed, you might remove its installation folder manually.
